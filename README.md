Pre-Alpha

This repository is a project that involves creating a new metric to monitor talent in the National Basketball Association that evaluates players based on weighted averages that exclude the top 40 scorers in the league. 
It seeks to be a benchmark analytical tool to evaluate not the best players on each team, but to find value in players whose stats may not seem to be amazing at a glance.
I then utilize a Long Short-term Memory neural network to find hidden relationships in the data to predict how the careers of current players will evolve based on this metric.
